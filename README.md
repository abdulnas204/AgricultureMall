# GlobalAgroMall 
The development of the agriculture mall requires the facility that introduces the concept of centralized database and decentralized client-side applications so that system can be updated any time with live environment and thus client is able to have services of getting product for agriculture information at any point of time.
Our system will be a web based application whose main language of programming will be PHP CODEIGNITER FRAMWORK. <br/>
It has main aim to simplify and improve the efficiency of the ordering process for both seller and user, minimize manual data entry and ensure data accuracy with security during ordering process. 
User can easily find most of agriculture product in our website. <br/>
This website enables the end users to register, select/view/order the agriculture product from the e-menu card, seller can manipulate with products, and Admin will manage the seller.
There are several system components that combines and makes up a broadly useful “AGRICULTURE MALL” <br/>
